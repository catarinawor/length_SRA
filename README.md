# length-SRA
Length based SRA

This model is a length-based stock reduction analysis that bypasses the requirement of estimating selectivity 
by calculating exploitation rate at length directly from observed catch at length data. 


The model was written in ADMB and the stock assessment routine is under admb/SA folder.

More instructions on the model and simulation evaluation routines to come.
