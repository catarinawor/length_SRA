	abstract = {Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, the most abundant groundfish in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), is a species of both commercial significance, supporting a large international fishery, and ecological importance, connecting other species as both predator and prey. Coastal Pacific hake migrations are characterized by movements between northern summer feeding areas and southern winter spawning areas, with variations in annual abundance, distribution, and the extent of these movements associated with varying climate-ocean conditions. In general, warm (cool) years with enhanced (reduced) stratification and poleward (equatorward) transport are often related to good (poor) recruitment, increased (decreased) northward distribution, and reduced (enhanced) growth. However, the classic periodic pattern of annual migration and distribution may no longer be fully representative. Based on recent advances in the understanding of climate-ocean variability off the U.S. west coast, we hypothesize that the annual movements of Pacific hake are more responsive to climate-ocean variability than previously thought, and further, that changes observed in Pacific hake distributions may reflect long-term changes in climate-ocean conditions in the CCLME. Therefore, an updated model of these relations is key to effective monitoring and management of this stock, as well as to devising scenarios of future change in the CCLME as a result of climate variations. The current state of knowledge of the relationship between the Pacific hake and its environment is reviewed, highlighting emerging ideas compared to those of the past, and priorities for future research are suggested.},

Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty.},

Two common approaches for dealing with time-varying selectivity in assessment models are the use of discrete time-blocks associated with an epoch in the history of the fishery, or the use of penalized random walk models for parametric or non-parametric selectivity curves. Time block periods, or penalty weights associated with time-varying selectivity parameters, are subjective and often developed on an ad hoc basis. A factorial simulation{\textendash}estimation experiment, with discrete or continuous changes in selectivity, is conducted to determine the best practices for modeling time-varying selectivity in fisheries stock assessments.

	abstract = {Most population models and stock assessment approaches assume that fish and fishing are spatially uniform. Here, we examine the effects of spatial structure on fishery selection (selectivity). Selectivity refers to the fact that age- or size-classes of fish are not equally vulnerable to fishing; such differences in class-specific vulnerabilities will influence the age-structure of a fish stock, which in turn will determine the stock's productivity and ability to sustain harvest. The selectivity of the gear produces a characteristic selection curve that is generally assumed to be asymptotic. However, population-level selection curves can deviate considerably from an asymptotic shape given spatial structure in the population. For example, given time-invariant recruitment and time-invariant age-specific survival, the shape of the selection curve at the level of the population will be dome-shaped under a wide range of conditions, even though the gear-selection curves operating in common in all areas within the population are asymptotic. This paper explores the factors, under equilibrium conditions, influencing the areas-as-fleets selection curves that result from using selectivity coefficients to represent spatial catch-at-age in a non-spatial population dynamics model. We use a simplified set of survival equations from Sampson and Scott (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68 (2011) 1077{\textendash}1086), in which there are three distinct spatial regions with the same asymptotic selection curve operating in each region, and show that while the overall population-selectivity is typically dome shaped, the corresponding areas-as-fleets selection curve shapes differ from each other and from the population-selection and gear-selection curves. Factors that influence how much the selectivity curves differ from each other include the magnitude of the differences in the regional fishing mortality rates, the rates of fish movement and whether the movements are diffusive or directional, and the regional distribution of the recruits. If fish movement rates are relatively slow (say, less than 20\% per time-step), then in nearly all cases areas-as-fleets selectivity will differ from the underlying gear-selectivity, except under the extraordinary conditions of equal recruitment and equal fishing mortality across all spatial regions.},

For a length distribution collected in any year, their method provides an estimate of the age distribution corresponding to this length distribution, which is consistent with an age-length key constructed from the estimated age distribution and previously estimated length-at-age distributions. We show that this method is an application of the EM algorithm to mixtures of empirical distributions. Also, we give conditions for which these estimates of age distribution are unique, maximum likelihood estimates. The method is used to estimate age distributions of the catch of Greenland turbot, Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, by small Japanese freezer trawlers in the eastern Bering Sea.},

As well as living in the conventional habitats of lakes, ponds, rivers, rock pools and the open sea, fish have solved the problems of life in deserts, in the deep sea, in the cold antarctic, and in warm waters of high alkalinity or of low oxygen. Along with these adaptations, we find the most impressive specializations of morphology, physiology and behaviour. For example we can marvel at the high-speed swimming of the marlins, sailfish and warm-blooded tunas, air-breathing in catfish and lungfish, parental care in the mouth-brooding cichlids, and viviparity in many sharks and toothcarps. Moreover, fish are of considerable importance to the survival of the human species in the form of nutritious, delicious and diverse food. Rational exploitation and management of our global stocks of fishes must rely upon a detailed and precise insight of their biology. The Chapman \& Hall Fish and Fisheries Series aims to present timely volumes reviewing important aspects of fish biology. Most volumes will be of interest to research workers in biology, zoology, ecology and physiology but an additional aim is for the books to be accessible to a wide spectrum of non-specialist readers ranging from undergraduates and postgraduates to those with an interest in industrial and commercial aspects of fish and fisheries.},

Population-selectivity refers to a scaled version of the age- or size-specific fishing mortality experienced by a fish population. Although it is common to apply a sigmoid logistic curve for the selectivity produced by many kinds of fishing gear, the general characteristics of population{\textendash}selection curves have not been well examined. In this study, generalized additive models were fit to sets of selection coefficients taken from 15 recent stock assessments conducted using the virtual population analysis approach. The selection coefficients predicted by the models provided smoothed representations of the shapes and temporal dynamics of selectivity. Four broad types of selectivity were found: increasing, asymptotic, domed, and having a saddle. Four specific cases, each dominated by one type of selection curve, were examined in detail. For all 15 stocks, the population{\textendash}selection curves were not stable through time but underwent changes in shape, which in some cases were quite radical. Temporal variation in population-selectivity has important implications for the conduct of fisheries modelling activities such as evaluating management strategies and forecasting catch and stock size.},

	abstract = {In fishery stock assessments, catch equations provide the critical link between stock size, natural mortality rate, fishing rate, and catch size. Catch equations are most powerful when age data are available, allowing cohorts to be followed through time using Virtual Population and Cohort Analysis. In this paper we propose a simple new method of linking catch equations when age data are not available. Assuming catches are given in biomass, catch equations are written for each year with a constant recruitment (R), based on a single parameter, added to the total biomass at the beginning of each year. In addition to the catch equations, a final equation is added describing the change in biomass caused by the years of fishing. If n years of catch data are available, n + 1 equations can be written. By conditioning on instantaneous natural mortality rate (M), initial stock size (B1) and the decline in stock size (P) (note P = Bn+1/B1), the n + 1 simultaneous nonlinear equations can be solved iteratively for ins..., Dans l'{\'e}valuation des stocks p{\^e}ch{\'e}s, les {\'e}quations de capture sont un lien critique entre l'importance du stock, le taux de mortalit{\'e} naturelle, le taux de p{\^e}che et le volume des prises.

	abstract = {The recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in Europe highlights the need for improvements in both species and size selectivity. Regarding size selectivity, shifting selectivity towards older/larger fish avoids both growth and recruitment overfishing and reduces unwanted catches. However, the benefits to fish stocks and fishery yields from increasing age/size-at-selection are still being challenged and the relative importance of selectivity compared to that of exploitation rate remains unclear. Consequently, exploitation rate regulations continue to dominate management. Here, an age-structured population model parameterized for a wide range of stocks is used to investigate the effects of selectivity on spawning stock biomass (SSB) and yield. The generic effect of selectivity on SSB and yield over a wide range of stocks is compared to the respective relative effects of exploitation rate and several biological parameters. We show that yield is mainly driven by biological parameters, while SSB is mostly affected by the exploitation regime (i.e. exploitation rate and selectivity). Our analysis highlights the importance of selectivity for fisheries sustainability. Catching fish a year or more after they mature combined with an intermediate exploitation rate (F~?~0.3) promotes high sustainable yields at low levels of stock depletion. Examination of the empirical exploitation regimes of 31 NE Atlantic stocks illustrates the unfulfilled potential of most stocks for higher sustainable yields due to high juvenile selection, thus underscoring the importance of protecting juveniles. Explicitly incorporating selectivity scenarios in fisheries advice would allow the identification of optimal exploitation regimes and benefit results-based management.},

Observations of age or length composition from fisheries or research surveys are modelled frequently with the multinomial distribution. Violations of multinomial assumptions in data collection usually cause overdispersion of observations and consequent underestimation of uncertainty. This has led to the adoption of an effective sample size less than the actual sample size to approximate the likelihood function for age or length composition better in, for example, fishery stock assessment models. The behaviour of effective sample size is examined under different scenarios for population age distribution and sampling design. Effective sample size was approximated with three approaches: (i) the ratio of multinomial to empirical variance; (ii) sampling estimation; and (iii) the Dirichlet likelihood. The most significant changes in effective sample size were attributable to process error involving aggregation of ages within schools. In terms of observation error, effective sample size can be increased by increasing the number of tows from which samples are obtained for age or length composition, then, because of the reduced uncertainty in effective sample size, the Dirichlet likelihood can be integrated into the objective function of fishery stock assessment models to estimate the effective sample size in future assessments.},

	abstract = {Virtual population analysis (VPA) is often used in conjunction with survey data to provide estimates of current stock size and an allowable catch that is sustainable in the sense that it is expected to produce some desired trend (or stability) in stock size. But these estimates are generally very uncertain, and should be accompanied by statements about the odds of sustainability for a range of allowable catch options. The odds can be expressed as an easily understood short-term risk function, but potential cumulative risks associated with the function should be simulated as a long-term guide for management. Bayesian estimates of the odds of sustainability can be calculated using the likelihood function of the survey data for different current stock size and natural mortality rate possibilities, with estimates of expected recruitment and recruitment variability. Prerecruitment year classes in the survey are included in the calculation of expected recruitment and its uncertainty, allowing use of survey data..., L'analyse virtuelle des populations (VPA) est souvent associ{\'e}e aux r{\'e}sultats de d{\'e}nombrements pour produire des estimations de l'importance des stocks actuels ainsi que de la prise admissible {\`a} un niveau soutenable, au sens o{\`u} on s'attend qu'elle produira une tendance souhait{\'e}e (ou la stabilit{\'e}) chez ce stock.

	abstract = {Time-varying selectivity is one of the main challenges in single species age-based assessment models. In classical deterministic VPA-type models the fishing mortality rates are unfiltered representations of the observed catches. As a consequence the selectivity becomes time-varying, but this representation is too fluctuating, because it includes the observation noise. In parametric statistical catch at age models a common assumption is that the selectivity is constant in all years, although time-varying selectivity can be introduced by splitting the data period in blocks with different selectivities, or by using smoothing splines and penalized time-deviances. However, these methods require subjective choices w.r.t. the degree of time-varying allowed. A simple state-space assessment model is presented as an alternative, which among other benefits offers an objective way of estimating time-varying selectivity pattern. The fishing mortality rates are considered (possibly correlated) stochastic processes, and the corresponding process variances are estimated within the model. The model is applied to North Sea cod and it is verified from simulations that time-varying selectivity can be estimated.},

	abstract = {Integral projection models (IPMs) have a number of advantages over matrix-model approaches for analyzing size-structured population dynamics, because the latter require parameter estimates for each age or stage transition. However, IPMs still require appropriate data. Typically they are parameterized using individual-scale relationships between body size and demographic rates, but these are not always available. We present an alternative approach for estimating demographic parameters from time series of size-structured survey data using a Bayesian state-space IPM (SSIPM). By fitting an IPM in a state-space framework, we estimate unknown parameters and explicitly account for process and measurement error in a dataset to estimate the underlying process model dynamics. We tested our method by fitting SSIPMs to simulated data; the model fit the simulated size distributions well and estimated unknown demographic parameters accurately. We then illustrated our method using nine years of annual surveys of the density and size distribution of two fish species (blue rockfish, Sebastes mystinus, and gopher rockfish, S.~carnatus) at seven kelp forest sites in California. The SSIPM produced reasonable fits to the data, and estimated fishing rates for both species that were higher than our Bayesian prior estimates based on coast-wide stock assessment estimates of harvest. That improvement reinforces the value of being able to estimate demographic parameters from local-scale monitoring data. We highlight a number of key decision points in SSIPM development (e.g., open vs. closed demography, number of particles in the state-space filter) so that users can apply the method to their own datasets.},

	abstract = {Legislative changes in the United States and elsewhere now require scientific advice on catch limits for data-poor fisheries. The family of stock reduction analysis (SRA) models is widely used to calculate sustainable harvest levels given a time series of harvest data. SRA works by solving the catch equation given an assumed value for spawning biomass relative to unfished levels in the final (or recent) year, and resulting estimates of recent fishing mortality are biased when this assumed value is mis-specified. We therefore propose to replace this assumption when estimating stock status by using compositional data in recent years to estimate a catch curve and hence estimating fishing mortality in those years. We compare this new {\textquotedblleft}catch-curve stock reduction analysis{\textquotedblright} (CC-SRA) with an SRA or catch curve using simulated data for slow or fast life histories and various magnitudes of recruitment variability. Results confirm that the SRA yields biased estimates of current fishing mortality given mis-specified information about recent spawning biomass, and that the catch curve is biased due to changes in fishing mortality over time. CC-SRA, by contrast, is approximately unbiased for low or moderate recruitment variability, and less biased than other methods given high recruitment variability. We therefore recommend CC-SRA as a data-poor assessment method that incorporates compositional data collection in recent years, and suggest future management strategy evaluation given a data-poor control rule.},

	abstract = {Scientists and resource managers need to know life history parameters (e.g., average mortality rate, individual growth rate, maximum length or mass, and timing of maturity) to understand and respond to risks to natural populations and ecosystems. For over 100 years, scientists have identified {\textquotedblleft}life history invariants{\textquotedblright} (LHI) representing pairs of parameters whose ratio is theorized to be constant across species. LHI then promise to allow prediction of many parameters from field measurements of a few important traits. Using LHI in this way, however, neglects any residual patterns in parameters when making predictions. We therefore apply a multivariate model for eight variables (seven parameters and temperature) in over 32,000 fishes, and include taxonomic structure for residuals (with levels for class, order, family, genus, and species). We illustrate that this approach predicts variables probabilistically for taxa with many or few data. We then use this model to resolve three questions regarding life history parameters in fishes. Specifically we show that (1) on average there is a 1.24\% decrease in the Brody growth coefficient for every 1\% increase in maximum size; (2) the ratio of natural mortality rate and growth coefficient is not an LHI but instead varies systematically based on the timing of maturation, where movement along this life history axis is predictably correlated with species taxonomy; and (3) three variables must be known per species to precisely predict remaining life history variables. We distribute our predictive model as an R package, FishLife, to allow future life history predictions for fishes to be conditioned on taxonomy and life history data for fishes worldwide. This package also contains predictions (and predictive intervals) for mortality, maturity, size, and growth parameters for all described fishes.},

Conventional stock assessment tools that rely on length measurements without total catch do not directly account for variable fishing mortality and recruitment over time. However, this equilibrium assumption is likely violated in almost every fishery, degrading estimation performance. We developed an extension of length-only approaches to account for time-varying recruitment and fishing mortality. This Length-based Integrated Mixed Effects (LIME) method at a minimum requires a single year of length data and basic biological information but can fit to multiple years of length data, catch, and an abundance index if available. We use simulation testing to demonstrate that LIME can estimate how much fishing has reduced spawning output in the most recent year across a variety of scenarios for recruitment and fishing mortality. LIME improves data-limited fisheries stock assessments by its flexibility to incorporate additional years or types of data if available and obviates the need for equilibrium assumptions.},
