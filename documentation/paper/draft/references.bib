  abstract = {Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, the most abundant groundfish in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), is a species of both commercial significance, supporting a large international fishery, and ecological importance, connecting other species as both predator and prey. Coastal Pacific hake migrations are characterized by movements between northern summer feeding areas and southern winter spawning areas, with variations in annual abundance, distribution, and the extent of these movements associated with varying climate-ocean conditions. In general, warm (cool) years with enhanced (reduced) stratification and poleward (equatorward) transport are often related to good (poor) recruitment, increased (decreased) northward distribution, and reduced (enhanced) growth. However, the classic periodic pattern of annual migration and distribution may no longer be fully representative. Based on recent advances in the understanding of climate-ocean variability off the U.S. west coast, we hypothesize that the annual movements of Pacific hake are more responsive to climate-ocean variability than previously thought, and further, that changes observed in Pacific hake distributions may reflect long-term changes in climate-ocean conditions in the CCLME. Therefore, an updated model of these relations is key to effective monitoring and management of this stock, as well as to devising scenarios of future change in the CCLME as a result of climate variations. The current state of knowledge of the relationship between the Pacific hake and its environment is reviewed, highlighting emerging ideas compared to those of the past, and priorities for future research are suggested.},

Two common approaches for dealing with time-varying selectivity in assessment models are the use of discrete time-blocks associated with an epoch in the history of the fishery, or the use of penalized random walk models for parametric or non-parametric selectivity curves. Time block periods, or penalty weights associated with time-varying selectivity parameters, are subjective and often developed on an ad hoc basis. A factorial simulation\textendash{}estimation experiment, with discrete or continuous changes in selectivity, is conducted to determine the best practices for modeling time-varying selectivity in fisheries stock assessments. Both the statistical properties of the assessment model and the policy implications of choosing the wrong model are taken into consideration.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.fishres.2014.01.009},
  abstract = {Most population models and stock assessment approaches assume that fish and fishing are spatially uniform. Here, we examine the effects of spatial structure on fishery selection (selectivity). Selectivity refers to the fact that age- or size-classes of fish are not equally vulnerable to fishing; such differences in class-specific vulnerabilities will influence the age-structure of a fish stock, which in turn will determine the stock's productivity and ability to sustain harvest. The selectivity of the gear produces a characteristic selection curve that is generally assumed to be asymptotic. However, population-level selection curves can deviate considerably from an asymptotic shape given spatial structure in the population. For example, given time-invariant recruitment and time-invariant age-specific survival, the shape of the selection curve at the level of the population will be dome-shaped under a wide range of conditions, even though the gear-selection curves operating in common in all areas within the population are asymptotic. This paper explores the factors, under equilibrium conditions, influencing the areas-as-fleets selection curves that result from using selectivity coefficients to represent spatial catch-at-age in a non-spatial population dynamics model. We use a simplified set of survival equations from Sampson and Scott (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68 (2011) 1077\textendash{}1086), in which there are three distinct spatial regions with the same asymptotic selection curve operating in each region, and show that while the overall population-selectivity is typically dome shaped, the corresponding areas-as-fleets selection curve shapes differ from each other and from the population-selection and gear-selection curves. Factors that influence how much the selectivity curves differ from each other include the magnitude of the differences in the regional fishing mortality rates, the rates of fish movement and whether the movements are diffusive or directional, and the regional distribution of the recruits. If fish movement rates are relatively slow (say, less than 20\% per time-step), then in nearly all cases areas-as-fleets selectivity will differ from the underlying gear-selectivity, except under the extraordinary conditions of equal recruitment and equal fishing mortality across all spatial regions.},

For a length distribution collected in any year, their method provides an estimate of the age distribution corresponding to this length distribution, which is consistent with an age-length key constructed from the estimated age distribution and previously estimated length-at-age distributions. We show that this method is an application of the EM algorithm to mixtures of empirical distributions. Also, we give conditions for which these estimates of age distribution are unique, maximum likelihood estimates. The method is used to estimate age distributions of the catch of Greenland turbot, Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, by small Japanese freezer trawlers in the eastern Bering Sea.},

As well as living in the conventional habitats of lakes, ponds, rivers, rock pools and the open sea, fish have solved the problems of life in deserts, in the deep sea, in the cold antarctic, and in warm waters of high alkalinity or of low oxygen. Along with these adaptations, we find the most impressive specializations of morphology, physiology and behaviour. For example we can marvel at the high-speed swimming of the marlins, sailfish and warm-blooded tunas, air-breathing in catfish and lungfish, parental care in the mouth-brooding cichlids, and viviparity in many sharks and toothcarps. Moreover, fish are of considerable importance to the survival of the human species in the form of nutritious, delicious and diverse food. Rational exploitation and management of our global stocks of fishes must rely upon a detailed and precise insight of their biology. The Chapman \& Hall Fish and Fisheries Series aims to present timely volumes reviewing important aspects of fish biology. Most volumes will be of interest to research workers in biology, zoology, ecology and physiology but an additional aim is for the books to be accessible to a wide spectrum of non-specialist readers ranging from undergraduates and postgraduates to those with an interest in industrial and commercial aspects of fish and fisheries.},

  abstract = {Time-varying selectivity is one of the main challenges in single species age-based assessment models. In classical deterministic VPA-type models the fishing mortality rates are unfiltered representations of the observed catches. As a consequence the selectivity becomes time-varying, but this representation is too fluctuating, because it includes the observation noise. In parametric statistical catch at age models a common assumption is that the selectivity is constant in all years, although time-varying selectivity can be introduced by splitting the data period in blocks with different selectivities, or by using smoothing splines and penalized time-deviances. However, these methods require subjective choices w.r.t. the degree of time-varying allowed. A simple state-space assessment model is presented as an alternative, which among other benefits offers an objective way of estimating time-varying selectivity pattern. The fishing mortality rates are considered (possibly correlated) stochastic processes, and the corresponding process variances are estimated within the model. The model is applied to North Sea cod and it is verified from simulations that time-varying selectivity can be estimated.},

Population-selectivity refers to a scaled version of the age- or size-specific fishing mortality experienced by a fish population. Although it is common to apply a sigmoid logistic curve for the selectivity produced by many kinds of fishing gear, the general characteristics of population\textendash{}selection curves have not been well examined. In this study, generalized additive models were fit to sets of selection coefficients taken from 15 recent stock assessments conducted using the virtual population analysis approach. The selection coefficients predicted by the models provided smoothed representations of the shapes and temporal dynamics of selectivity. Four broad types of selectivity were found: increasing, asymptotic, domed, and having a saddle. Four specific cases, each dominated by one type of selection curve, were examined in detail. For all 15 stocks, the population\textendash{}selection curves were not stable through time but underwent changes in shape, which in some cases were quite radical. Temporal variation in population-selectivity has important implications for the conduct of fisheries modelling activities such as evaluating management strategies and forecasting catch and stock size.},

  abstract = {Stock reduction analysis (SRA) can complement more detailed assessment methods by using long-term historical catches to estimate recruitment rates needed to have produced those catches, yet still end up with stock sizes near those estimated by the detailed methods. A longer historical perspective can also add information to the estimation of reference points such as unfished biomass (B0) or target biomass (BMSY). Deterministic SRA models provide a single stock size trajectory that is vanishingly unlikely to have actually occurred, while stochastic SRA attempts to provide probability distributions for stock size over time under alternative hypotheses about unfished recruitment rates and about variability around assumed stockrecruitment relationships. These distributions can be generated with age-structured population models by doing large numbers of Monte Carlo simulation trials and retaining those sample trials for which the stock would not have been driven to extinction by historical catches. By resampl..., L'analyse de r{\'e}duction des stocks (SRA) peut {\^e}tre compl{\'e}mentaire des m{\'e}thodes plus d{\'e}taill{\'e}es d'{\'e}valuation, car elle utilise les captures {\`a} long terme du pass{\'e} afin d'estimer les taux de recrutement n{\'e}cessaires pour la production de ces captures, tout en produisant des estimations de la taille des stocks qui se rapprochent de celles obtenues par les m{\'e}thodes d{\'e}taill{\'e}es. Une perspective historique plus {\'e}tendue donne des renseignements suppl{\'e}mentaires pour l'estimation des points de r{\'e}f{\'e}rence, tels que la biomasse non exploit{\'e}e (B0) et la biomasse cibl{\'e}e (BMSY). Les mod{\`e}les SRA d{\'e}terministes g{\'e}n{\`e}rent une seule trajectoire de la taille du stock dont l'existence est de moins en moins improbable, alors que les essais SRA stochastiques donnent une distribution de probabilit{\'e} des tailles du stock en fonction du temps sous diverses hypoth{\`e}ses concernant les taux de recrutement dans des conditions de non exploitation et concernant la variabilit{\'e} reli{\'e}e aux relations stockrecrutement pr{\'e}suppos{\'e}es.
