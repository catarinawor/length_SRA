	abstract = {Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, the most abundant groundfish in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), is a species of both commercial significance, supporting a large international fishery, and ecological importance, connecting other species as both predator and prey. Coastal Pacific hake migrations are characterized by movements between northern summer feeding areas and southern winter spawning areas, with variations in annual abundance, distribution, and the extent of these movements associated with varying climate-ocean conditions. In general, warm (cool) years with enhanced (reduced) stratification and poleward (equatorward) transport are often related to good (poor) recruitment, increased (decreased) northward distribution, and reduced (enhanced) growth. However, the classic periodic pattern of annual migration and distribution may no longer be fully representative. Based on recent advances in the understanding of climate-ocean variability off the U.S. west coast, we hypothesize that the annual movements of Pacific hake are more responsive to climate-ocean variability than previously thought, and further, that changes observed in Pacific hake distributions may reflect long-term changes in climate-ocean conditions in the CCLME. Therefore, an updated model of these relations is key to effective monitoring and management of this stock, as well as to devising scenarios of future change in the CCLME as a result of climate variations. The current state of knowledge of the relationship between the Pacific hake and its environment is reviewed, highlighting emerging ideas compared to those of the past, and priorities for future research are suggested.},

Two common approaches for dealing with time-varying selectivity in assessment models are the use of discrete time-blocks associated with an epoch in the history of the fishery, or the use of penalized random walk models for parametric or non-parametric selectivity curves. Time block periods, or penalty weights associated with time-varying selectivity parameters, are subjective and often developed on an ad hoc basis. A factorial simulation–estimation experiment, with discrete or continuous changes in selectivity, is conducted to determine the best practices for modeling time-varying selectivity in fisheries stock assessments. Both the statistical properties of the assessment model and the policy implications of choosing the wrong model are taken into consideration.},

	abstract = {Most population models and stock assessment approaches assume that fish and fishing are spatially uniform. Here, we examine the effects of spatial structure on fishery selection (selectivity). Selectivity refers to the fact that age- or size-classes of fish are not equally vulnerable to fishing; such differences in class-specific vulnerabilities will influence the age-structure of a fish stock, which in turn will determine the stock's productivity and ability to sustain harvest. The selectivity of the gear produces a characteristic selection curve that is generally assumed to be asymptotic. However, population-level selection curves can deviate considerably from an asymptotic shape given spatial structure in the population. For example, given time-invariant recruitment and time-invariant age-specific survival, the shape of the selection curve at the level of the population will be dome-shaped under a wide range of conditions, even though the gear-selection curves operating in common in all areas within the population are asymptotic. This paper explores the factors, under equilibrium conditions, influencing the areas-as-fleets selection curves that result from using selectivity coefficients to represent spatial catch-at-age in a non-spatial population dynamics model. We use a simplified set of survival equations from Sampson and Scott (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68 (2011) 1077–1086), in which there are three distinct spatial regions with the same asymptotic selection curve operating in each region, and show that while the overall population-selectivity is typically dome shaped, the corresponding areas-as-fleets selection curve shapes differ from each other and from the population-selection and gear-selection curves. Factors that influence how much the selectivity curves differ from each other include the magnitude of the differences in the regional fishing mortality rates, the rates of fish movement and whether the movements are diffusive or directional, and the regional distribution of the recruits. If fish movement rates are relatively slow (say, less than 20\% per time-step), then in nearly all cases areas-as-fleets selectivity will differ from the underlying gear-selectivity, except under the extraordinary conditions of equal recruitment and equal fishing mortality across all spatial regions.},

In separate unpublished papers, Fukuda and Chikuni (Far Seas Fisheries Research Laboratory, Fisheries Agency of Japan, 1974) proposed a method of iterating an age-length key that corrects this problem. For a length distribution collected in any year, their method provides an estimate of the age distribution corresponding to this length distribution, which is consistent with an age-length key constructed from the estimated age distribution and previously estimated length-at-age distributions. We show that this method is an application of the EM algorithm to mixtures of empirical distributions. Also, we give conditions for which these estimates of age distribution are unique, maximum likelihood estimates.

Either model component, dynamic or observational, can be subject to statistical variation.

This paper presents a general framework for developing sequential fishery models and estimating model parameters from available data. The framework encompasses most traditional stock assessment models and suggests new, potentially useful extensions. It generalizes the conventional definition of state space model to include nonlinear equations with nonnormal error.

As well as living in the conventional habitats of lakes, ponds, rivers, rock pools and the open sea, fish have solved the problems of life in deserts, in the deep sea, in the cold antarctic, and in warm waters of high alkalinity or of low oxygen. Along with these adaptations, we find the most impressive specializations of morphology, physiology and behaviour. For example we can marvel at the high-speed swimming of the marlins, sailfish and warm-blooded tunas, air-breathing in catfish and lungfish, parental care in the mouth-brooding cichlids, and viviparity in many sharks and toothcarps. Moreover, fish are of considerable importance to the survival of the human species in the form of nutritious, delicious and diverse food. Rational exploitation and management of our global stocks of fishes must rely upon a detailed and precise insight of their biology. The Chapman \& Hall Fish and Fisheries Series aims to present timely volumes reviewing important aspects of fish biology. Most volumes will be of interest to research workers in biology, zoology, ecology and physiology but an additional aim is for the books to be accessible to a wide spectrum of non-specialist readers ranging from undergraduates and postgraduates to those with an interest in industrial and commercial aspects of fish and fisheries.},

	abstract = {Time-varying selectivity is one of the main challenges in single species age-based assessment models. In classical deterministic VPA-type models the fishing mortality rates are unfiltered representations of the observed catches. As a consequence the selectivity becomes time-varying, but this representation is too fluctuating, because it includes the observation noise. In parametric statistical catch at age models a common assumption is that the selectivity is constant in all years, although time-varying selectivity can be introduced by splitting the data period in blocks with different selectivities, or by using smoothing splines and penalized time-deviances. However, these methods require subjective choices w.r.t. the degree of time-varying allowed. A simple state-space assessment model is presented as an alternative, which among other benefits offers an objective way of estimating time-varying selectivity pattern. The fishing mortality rates are considered (possibly correlated) stochastic processes, and the corresponding process variances are estimated within the model. The model is applied to North Sea cod and it is verified from simulations that time-varying selectivity can be estimated.},

Population-selectivity refers to a scaled version of the age- or size-specific fishing mortality experienced by a fish population. Although it is common to apply a sigmoid logistic curve for the selectivity produced by many kinds of fishing gear, the general characteristics of population–selection curves have not been well examined. In this study, generalized additive models were fit to sets of selection coefficients taken from 15 recent stock assessments conducted using the virtual population analysis approach. The selection coefficients predicted by the models provided smoothed representations of the shapes and temporal dynamics of selectivity. Four broad types of selectivity were found: increasing, asymptotic, domed, and having a saddle. Four specific cases, each dominated by one type of selection curve, were examined in detail. For all 15 stocks, the population–selection curves were not stable through time but underwent changes in shape, which in some cases were quite radical. Temporal variation in population-selectivity has important implications for the conduct of fisheries modelling activities such as evaluating management strategies and forecasting catch and stock size.},

	abstract = {A length-structured population model, which incorporates von Bertalanffy growth, is used to describe changes in population abundance over time. The model is incorporated into a catch-at-length algorithm that uses a nonlinear least squares approach to estimate relative abundance, fishing mortality, selectivity, and the von Bertalanffy growth parameters L∞ and k. The algorithm is applied to a simulated data set for Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and to catch data on Pseudotolithus typus and Decapterus russellii. The parameter estimates of Pacific cod obtained from this algorithm were comparable with the values that were originally used to simulate the data. Although the catch data of P. typus did not exhibit the full range of sizes present in the population due to differential vulnerability of the population to the fishery, the estimates of L∞ and k reflect the growth over the entire size range of the population. Other population estimates for P. typus were in agreement with observed biological informati..., Nous avons utilisé un modèle de population fondé sur la répartition des tailles des poissons qui prend en compte les paramètres de croissance de von Bertalanffy pour décrire les variations de l'abondance d'une population dans le temps. Nous avons intégré ce modèle à un algorithme de prise par longueur qui utilise les moindres carrés de façon non linéaire pour estimer l'abondance, la mortalité due à la pêche et la sélectivité relatives de même que les paramètres de croissance L∞ et k de von Bertalanffy. L'algorithme a été appliqué à un ensemble de données simulées relatives à la morue du Pacifique (Gadus macrocephalus) et à des données de capture relatives à Pseudotolithus typus et Decapterus russellii. Les valeurs estimées des paramètres pour la morue du Pacifique obtenues grâce à cet algorithme étaient comparables à celles qui ont été utilisées originalement pour simuler les données. Même si les données de capture de P. typus ne couvraient pas l'ensemble de la fourcnette de taille de la population, à cau...},

	abstract = {The recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in Europe highlights the need for improvements in both species and size selectivity. Regarding size selectivity, shifting selectivity towards older/larger fish avoids both growth and recruitment overfishing and reduces unwanted catches. However, the benefits to fish stocks and fishery yields from increasing age/size-at-selection are still being challenged and the relative importance of selectivity compared to that of exploitation rate remains unclear. Consequently, exploitation rate regulations continue to dominate management. Here, an age-structured population model parameterized for a wide range of stocks is used to investigate the effects of selectivity on spawning stock biomass (SSB) and yield. The generic effect of selectivity on SSB and yield over a wide range of stocks is compared to the respective relative effects of exploitation rate and several biological parameters. We show that yield is mainly driven by biological parameters, while SSB is mostly affected by the exploitation regime (i.e. exploitation rate and selectivity). Our analysis highlights the importance of selectivity for fisheries sustainability. Catching fish a year or more after they mature combined with an intermediate exploitation rate (F ≈ 0.3) promotes high sustainable yields at low levels of stock depletion. Examination of the empirical exploitation regimes of 31 NE Atlantic stocks illustrates the unfulfilled potential of most stocks for higher sustainable yields due to high juvenile selection, thus underscoring the importance of protecting juveniles. Explicitly incorporating selectivity scenarios in fisheries advice would allow the identification of optimal exploitation regimes and benefit results-based management.},
