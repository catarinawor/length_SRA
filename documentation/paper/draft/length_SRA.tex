\section{Introduction}

%(old intro written by Carl Walters)
Modern stock assessments typically attempt to fit population dynamics models to catch at age and catch at length data, in hopes of extracting information from these data about age/size vulnerability and fishing mortality patterns \citep{methot_stock_2013,hilborn_quantitative_1992}.  In cases where age data are lacking, models like MULTIFAN-CL attempt to obtain estimates of vulnerability and fishing mortality only from size distribution data \citep{fournier_multifan-cl:_1998}. Combined with a few assumptions regarding the structure and variability in length at age, this procedure can even be used to attempt to recover information about changes in body growth patterns if there is a strong age-class signal in the length frequency data \citep{fournier_multifan-cl:_1998}.  Some assessment methods attempt to put aside the length frequency data, by converting these data to age compositions using age-from-length tables, perhaps using iterative methods to estimate proportions of fish at age for each length interval \citep{kimura_mixtures_1987}.  It is typical for assessment results from length-based assessment models to show substantial deviations between predicted and observed length distributions of catches, reflecting both sampling variation in the length composition data and incorrect assumptions about stability of growth and vulnerability patterns \citep{hilborn_quantitative_1992}. 
 
The vulnerability process is the combination of two processes: selectivity of the fishing gear and availability of the fished population in the area being fished \citep{beverton_dynamics_1957}. Both processes can vary over time and therefore modify the resulting selectivity. Although selectivity process can often be directly measured through gear experiments, availability is generally harder to measure as it depends on the distribution of the exploited population. Fish movement, changes in fish distribution, and by changes in fleet distribution, can all cause availability changes.Changes in vulnerability are not uncommon \citep{sampson_exploration_2012} but are usually difficult to track overtime. This difficulty is associated with an inability to distinguish between changes in fishing mortality and changes in vulnerability in most age and length based stock assessment methods. For this reason, many assessment methods rely on ad hoc parametric vulnerability models that may or may not include changes over time \citep{maunder_selectivity:_2014}. If misspecified, such models might lead to severe bias in fishing mortality estimates, which could result in misleading management advice \citep{martell_towards_2014}. 

 Here we suggest an alternative approach to assessment modeling that begins by assuming that the assessment model should exactly reproduce the observed catch at length distribution. This approach follows the dynamics of an age structred stock reduction analysis (SRA) \citep{walters_stochastic_2006-1} which follows a ``conditioned on catch'' format, subtracting observed catches at age from modeled numbers at age in estimation of numbers at age over time. This assumption is analogous to the classical assumption in virtual population analysis that reconstructed numbers at age should exactly match observed catch at age data \citep{hilborn_quantitative_1992}. The suggested approach may have two key advantages over statistical catch at age and/or catch at length models: (1) it does not require estimation of age or size vulnerability schedules, and (2) catch at length data are commonly available for every year, even when age composition sampling has not been conducted. 

 We demonstrate the performance of this model with a simulation-evaluation analysis and apply it to real fisheries data from the Peruvian jack mackerel (\emph{Trachurus murphyi}) and Pacific Hake (\emph{Merluccius productus}) fisheries. 



\section{Methods}

In this section we describe the stock reduction analysis with catch at length data (Length-SRA), describe the simulation analysis and scenarios used to test the model and provide a description of the real data used to illustrate the model applicability.


\subsection{Stock reduction analysis with catch at length data}

The stock reduction analysis described here starts by calculating the proportions of individual at length given each age class ($P_{l|a}$ - eqs. \ref{Pla1.1}-\ref{Pla1.5}). The calculation of such proportions (eq. \ref{Pla1.1}) relies on four main assumptions regarding the distribution of length at age: (1) The mean length at age follows a von Bertalanffy growth curve (eq.\ref{Pla1.4}), (2) The length at age is normally distributed (eqs. \ref{Pla1.1} -\ref{Pla1.3}), (3) The standard deviation of the length at age distributions is defined (e.g. eq.\ref{Pla1.5}) and (4) $P_{l|a}$ is constant for all lengths equal or greater than $L$ (eq.\ref{Pla1.3}).



 The proportions of length at age is used to convert the length-based quantities into age based quantities which are used to propagate the age structured population dynamics forward (Table \ref{tab:eqsall} - Population dynamics). We assume that recruitment follows a Beverton \& Holt type recruitment curve (eq. \ref{PD2.1}), that harvesting occurs over a short, discrete season in each time step (year or shorter time period) and that natural survival rate is stable over time (eqs. \ref{PD2.1}-\ref{PD2.5}). Differences in the computation of recruitment in the initial year (eq. \ref{AO.1}) as well as incidence functions (eqs. \ref{AO.2}-\ref{AO.6}) are shown in  Table \ref{tab:eqsall} - Initial year and incidence functions.

The model estimates three main parameters: average unexploited recruitment $R_{0}$, recruitment compensation ratio $\kappa$ and recruitment in the initial year $R_{init}$. In addition, the recruitment deviations $w_t$ are estimated for all cohorts observed in the model, that is, the number of recruitment deviations is equal to the number of years in the time series plus the number of age classes greater that recruitment age.  


The objective function (eq. \ref{Obj}) is composed of a negative log likelihood component, two penalties and a prior component for the recruitment compensation ratio $\kappa$. The negative log likelihood component minimizes the differences between the predicted and observed index of abundance (eq. \ref{PLL.1}). We assume that such differences are lognormally distributed (eqs. \ref{PLL.3}-\ref{PLL.4}) and use the conditional maximum likelihood estimator described by \citet{walters_calculation_1994} to estimate the catchability coefficient(eq. \ref{PLL.2}). A lognormal penalty is added to the negative log-likelihood function to constrain annual recruitment residuals so that the estimates have mean of zero and fixed standard deviation $\sigma_{R}$ (eq. \ref{pen.1}). An additional penalty was implemented in order to prevent estimated values of exploitation rate at length greater than one ($U_{l,t}>1$) (eq. \ref{pen.3}) . Lastly, a normal prior for $log(\kappa)$ was included in the objective function (eq. \ref{pr.1}).

\subsection{Simulation evaluation}

In order to perform a simulation evaluation of the Length-SRA under various scenarios we used the same model dynamics described in Table \ref{tab:eqsall} - Population dynamics, as an operating model. However we modified the model population dynamics to control annual exploitation rate (eq. \ref{OM4.1}), time varying selectivity (eq. \ref{OM4.3}), and observation and process errors. Selectivity in the operating model was computed with the three parameter selectivity equation described by \citet{thompson_confounding_1994} (eq. \ref{OM4.3}). The observation error in the operating model included lognormal error in the index of abundance and logistic multivariate error in the catch numbers at length. Recruitment deviations were assumed to be lognormally distributed.   


We considered a total of six different scenarios in the simulation evaluation runs. Three different historical exploitation rate trajectories were used: contrast, one way trip and $U$ ramp. In the contrast scenario the exploitation rate ($U_t$) starts low and increases beyond $U_{msy}$ and then decreases until $U_t=U_{msy}$. In the one way trip scenario $U$ increased through time until $U=2 \cdot U_{msy} $. In the $U$ ramp scenario, $U_t$ increases steadily until $U_t=U_{msy}$ and remains constant thereafter. In addition to the exploitation rate scenarios, we considered two selectivity scenarios: constant and time varying selectivity. In the constant selectivity scenario, selectivity was assumed to follow a sigmoid shape. In the time varying selectivity scenario, the selectivity curve was assumed to vary every year, progressively changing form a dome shaped curve to sigmoid and back to dome shaped. The complete list of scenarios and the acronym used for them is presented in Table \ref{tab:simeval}. 

All simulation runs had 30 years of data and we used 100 simulation runs for each scenario. We evaluated the distribution of the \% relative error ($ \frac{esimated-simulated}{simulated}$) for the main parameter estimates ($R_{0}$, $R_{init}$ and $\kappa$) and for four derived quantities (Depletion: $\frac{B_t}{B_{0}}$, MSY, $U_{MSY}$ and $q$).

\subsection{Real data examples}

Two species were chosen to illustrate the application of the Length-SRA to real datasets: Chilean jack mackerel and Pacific hake. Both species are believed to be subject to time varying selectivity. 

The Pacific hake fishery is believed to exhibit time varying selectivity due to cohort targeting and annual changes fleet spatial distribution. The population is know to have spasmodic recruitment, with high recruitment events occurring once or twice every decade \citep{ressler_pacific_2007}. Pacific hake tends to segregate by size during their annual migration\citep{ressler_pacific_2007}, allowing the fishing fleet to target the strong cohorts by changing the spatial distribution of fishing effort as the cohort ages. 

The movement pattern of jack mackerel is not as well known, although fish appear to move between spawning and feeding areas \citep{gerlotto_insight_2012}. Variability in selectivity patterns for the jack mackerel fishery are believed to be associated both with evolution of fleet capacity and gear utilization and with compression and expansion of the species range associated with abundance changes \citep{gerlotto_insight_2012}.


\section{Results}

\subsection{Simulation-evaluation}


Even though the parameter estimates were not entirely unbiased, the amount of bias was relatively low, with median \% error being always less than 25\% for all parameters. The parameters $R_0$ and $R_{init}$ were overestimated for all scenarios with the exception of the $U$ ramp scenarios (CR and VR) (Figure \ref{mainParams}). The median \% errors for $R_0$ ranged from -9.1\% to 15.4\%. For $R_{init}$ the median \% errors varied from -22.5\% to  13.3\%.  The parameter $\kappa$  was overestimated for all scenarios (Figure \ref{mainParams}) with median \% errors for $\kappa$ ranged from  11.3 \% to 18.9\%

\end{figure}




In relation to the derived quantities, the Length-SRA tended to underestimate both depletion and MSY estimates with median \% errors ranging between -34.9\% and -3.5\% . For both depletion and MSY quantities, the $U$ ramp scenarios (CR and VR) yielded the highest bias (Figure \ref{derivQuant}). The estimates for $U_{MSY}$ showed very low ($<$4\%) median \% errors for all scenarios (Figure \ref{derivQuant}). The estimates of $q$ were overestimated for all scenarios but were particularly biased for the the $U$ ramp scenarios (CR and VR) (Figure \ref{derivQuant}).

The simulation-evaluation exercise showed that the Length-SRA model is able to track selectivity changes over time relatively well. There is a tendency to underestimate selectivity for lower lengths and overestimate it for higher lengths across all scenarios, However, this pattern is particularly prominent for the $U$ ramp scenarios (Figure \ref{sel}).

\section{Discussion}

We present a length-based stock reduction analysis that allows monitoring of time varying selectivity.  In this model catch at length is assumed to be known without error and exploitation rate at length is derived directly from the estimates of numbers at length. This fact is important because it allows the mode to bypass the requirement for the estimation of a selectivity ogive, as is required in other length based models \citep{sullivan_catch-at-length_1990,fournier_multifan-cl:_1998}. 
  



Selectivity parameters can be particularly hard to estimate, especially it is changing over time and 


main conclusions:  
Length-SRA underestimates kappa productivity parameter

Management quantities Depletion and MSY are underestimated -  the model tends to produce conservative benchmarks.

UMSY estimates had low bias-  good?

U ramp scenario yield very bad results - lack of information in the time series. 


Model is able to track selectivity over time, - good

How does it compare to other length based models



Does the model work? Could it produce useful management advice?
My nee dto evaluate in a closed loop frameworks to be certain.

Time- varying growth might render the model less useful. Suggest estimating 
cohort-specific growth curves or implementing the density dependent functions shown in multifan-CL. 

Further testing of this model in a closed-loop simulation set up would provide more insight into how
