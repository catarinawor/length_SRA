\section{Introduction}

%(old intro written by Carl Walters)
Modern stock assessments typically attempt to fit population dynamics models to catch at age and catch at length data, in hopes of extracting information from these data about age/size vulnerability and fishing mortality patterns \citep{methot_stock_2013,hilborn_quantitative_1992}.  In cases where age data are lacking, softwares like MULTIFAN-CL attempt to obtain estimates of vulnerability and fishing mortality only from size distribution data \citep{fournier_multifan-cl:_1998}. Combined with a few assumptions regarding the structure and variability in length at age, this procedure can even be used to attempt to recover information about changes in body growth patterns if there is a strong age-class signal in the length frequency data \citep{fournier_multifan-cl:_1998}.  Some older assessment methods attempt to put aside the length frequency data, by converting these data to age compositions using age-from-length tables, perhaps using iterative methods to estimate proportions of fish at age for each length interval (e.g. Shirippa and Goodyear, ref.).  It is typical for assessment results from length-based assessment models to show substantial deviations between predicted and observed length distributions of catches, reflecting both sampling variation in the length composition data and incorrect assumptions about stability of both growth and vulnerability patterns. 
 

 Here we suggest an alternative approach to assessment modeling that begins by assuming that the assessment model should exactly reproduce the observed catch at length distribution.  This is similar to the classical assumption in virtual population analysis that reconstructed numbers at age should exactly match observed catch at age data, or the suggestion by Schnute (ref) that statistical catch at age models might best be run in a “conditioned on catch” format by subtracting observed catches at age from modeled numbers at age in estimation of numbers at age over time.  The suggested approach may have two key advantages over statistical catch at age and/or catch at length models: (1) it does not require estimation of age or size vulnerability schedules, and (2) catch at length data are commonly available for every year, even when age composition sampling has not been conducted. 

 We demonstrate the performance of this model with a simulation-evaluation analysis and apply it to real fisheries data from the Chilean jack mackerel and Pacific Hake fisheries. 




\section{Methods}

In this section we describe the stock reduction analysis with catch at length data, describe the simulation analysis and scenarios used to test the model and provide a description of the real data used to illustrate the model applicability.




\subsection{Stock reduction analysis with catch at length data}

The stock reduction analysis described here starts by calculating , the proportions of individual at length for each age class (Table \ref{tab:length_age}. The calculation of such proportions relies on three main assumptions regarding the distribution of length at age: (1) The mean length at age follows a von Bertalanffy growth curve \ref{T1.4}, (2) The length at age is normally distributed \ref{T1.1} and (3) The standard deviations of the length at age distributions is given by the product of the mean length at age and a constant cv \ref{T1.5}.

 The proportions of length at age is used to convert the length based quantities into age based quantities which are used to propagate the age structured population dynamics forward. We assume that recruitment follows a Beverton and Holt type recruitment curve, that harvesting occurs over a short, discrete season in each time step (year or shorter time period) and that natural survival rate is stable over time (Table \ref{tab:pop_dyn})
