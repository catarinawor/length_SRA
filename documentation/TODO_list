1) new file structures.: I've been working on the model this past week and did some good progress. I changed the file /folder structure though, so I could keep track of the files. 
the new arrangement is on github: https://github.com/catarinawor/length_SRA

2) Github: I will continue to use it, because I'm used to and all my work is on git. But you  don't have to. I can keep sending you updated versions or we can open a dropbox to share the files. whatever is easier for you.

3) Next steps (there are many of those):

a) come up with interesting time varying selectivity scenarios.
  - dome shaped selectivity - 3 parameter formulation
  	time varying beta -  autocorrelated change over time. - maybe a couple scenarios.
  	just vary mu50
  	vary mu50 and make it dome shaped.

  - two data availability scenarios 40yrs, 15yrs of data.
  - growth varying  - linf  decreasing over time 
  - linf being density dependent

  - Contrasting U and one-way-trip U

b) simeval species characteristics, are we going to do mere than one?


c) case studies with real data
